I consider myself as a trace metal geochemist; I am interested in applying stable isotope tools to the studies of ocean, environmental and Earth sciences. Examples include tracing hydrothermal inputs of iron to the oceans using iron isotopes, investigating chromium biogeochemical cycle in various environments, as well as assessing stable rhenium isotopes as paleo proxy. I have been involved in the international GEOTRACES community. I obtained my PhD at the University of Southampton, pursued a postdoc at Royal Holloway University of London and am currently undertaking a MSCA individual fellowship at the University of Vienna.
